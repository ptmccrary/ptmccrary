I'm a full-stack web developer for Journey Group Inc. Currently I specialize in Nuxt.js, and Drupal websites with a little Laravel API experience sprinkled in.

I started my path of web development shortly after realizing that nursing wasn't what I wanted to do, in my first few years of college. I fell in love with bringing things to life on the web as well as making things happen behind the curtains, so instinctly I switched my major to computer science and received an associate degree. Luckily, right after college I landed an amazing intership with Journey Group where I learned a boat load and landed a full-time position with them shortly after.
